Abstract:
Projection (or dimensionionality reduction) techniques have been used as a means to han-
dling the growing dimensionality of data sets as well as providing a way to visualize in-
formation coded into point relationships. Their role is essential in data interpretation and
simultaneous use of different projections and their visualizations improve data understand-
ing and increase the level of confidence in the result. For that purpose projections should
be fast to allow multiple views of the same data set. In this work we present a novel
fast technique for projecting multi-dimensional data sets into bidimensional (2D) spaces
that preserves neighborhood relationships. Additionally, a new technique for improving 2D
projections from multi-dimensional data is presented, that helps reduce the inherent loss
of information yielded by dimensionality reduction. The results are stimulating and are
presented in the form of comparative visualizations against known and new 2D projection
techniques. Based on the projection improvement approach presented here, a new metric
for quality of projection is also given, that matches well the visual perception of quality.
We discuss the implication of using improved projections in visual exploration of large data
sets and the role of interaction in visualization of projected subspaces.
